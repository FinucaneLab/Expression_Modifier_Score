- `pip_ems_alltissues.py` was used to calculate the functionally informed PIP using EMS as a prior
- `rf_performance_comparison.py` was used to compare the performance of random forest classifier with different features or predictors (Fig. S19)
- `susie_vs_fm.py` was used to compare the functional enrichment in putative eQTLs identified in SuSiE vs FINEMAP (Fig. S4)
- `pip_ems_heatmap.py` was used to draw a heatmap that compares PIP using EMS as a prior vs uniform prior (Fig. 2a,b, File S1, 2)
- `pip_ems_minmax100.py` was used to compare the constrained functional prior (max/min ratio < 100) (Fig. S16)
