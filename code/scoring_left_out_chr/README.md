This directory stores codes used for scoring GTEx variant-genes in Whole Blood per chromosome using the predictors trained on other chromosomes.

For more readable format (which essentially provides the same steps, except for excluding the left-out chromosome in the training) can be found in the `
training_EMS ` and `
scoring_GTEx_variant_genes` section.
