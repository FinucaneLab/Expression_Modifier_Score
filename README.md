# Expression Modifier Score (EMS)
Welcome to the github page for the ["Leveraging supervised learning for functionally-informed fine-mapping of cis-eQTLs identifies an additional 20,913 putative causal eQTLs"](link) manuscript, which introduces the Expression Modifier Score (EMS) and its applications to functionally-informed fine mapping and co-localization. 

The `tutorial.ipynb` explains how to annotate EMS in your own dataset using [hail](https://hail.is/index.html) in a cloud.
Since most of the analysis was performed in hail, we recommend users who are not familiar with Hail to visit the [Hail tutorial page](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/tutorials-landing.html).

For those who are not familiar with hail, he `tutorial_local.ipynb` explains how to annotate EMS in local (EMS for a subset of variant is also availabel on [our dropbox](link)). 

The scripts used in the EMS paper are stored in the `code` directory.
