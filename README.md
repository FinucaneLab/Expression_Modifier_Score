# Expression Modifier Score (EMS)
Welcome to the github page for the ["Predicting the probability of cis-regulatory effects in the human genome with supervised learning from 14,807 fine-mapped eQTLs and 6,121 features"](link) manuscript, which introduces the Expression Modifier Score (EMS). 

The `tutorial.ipynb` explains how to annotate EMS in your own dataset.

Since most of the analysis was performed in Hail, we recommend users who are not familiat with Hail to visit the [Hail tutorial page](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/tutorials-landing.html).

The scripts used in the EMS paper are stored in the `code` directory.
